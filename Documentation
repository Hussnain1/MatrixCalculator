Matrix Calculator

Language used:	
•	JAVA

Sample file format:
•	1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 9 
•	9 8 7;6 5 4;4 3 1
•	1 1 4;3 3 5;3 4 8
•	4 5 3;3 3 3;1 2 4
•	3 2 1;0 1 0;9 2 1

Tokenization:
1.	On the basis of ‘\n’ to separate matrices
2.	On the bases of ‘;’ to separate rows in a matrix
3.	On the bases of ‘ ’ (space) to separate elements in a row

For tokenization:
	Following functions are used:
1.	StringTokenizer
2.	split()


Functions Implemented:
•	readfromfile()
	Read matrices from a file whose path is given in this function
	Change the path to run on your laptop
	Tokenize them as described above
	Parses from string to integer and stores a matrix in a 2D array element by element
	Saves this 2D array in ArrayList ‘listmatrix’
	Saves rows and columns in two separate lists 
	Keeps on repeating until file is finished


•	addition(index1, index2)
	Addition of two matrices based on indexes given in function arguments
•	subtraction(index1, index2)
	Subtraction of two matrices based on indexes given in function arguments
•	multiplication(index1, index2)
	Multiplication of two matrices based on indexes given in function arguments
Unit Tests:
1.	Multiply 2 matrices. 
2.	Add 3 matrices. 
3.	Multiply 2 matrices and then add a 3rd one to the result. 

All three unit tests are running perfectly.


Exception Handling:

•	Check the order of two matrices for addition and subtraction.
•	If order is same, addition and subtraction is done.
•	If not, prints error and does not add two matrices.


•	Checks the condition for multiplication of two matrices.
•	If number of columns of matrix1 are equal to number of rows of matrix2, multiplication is done.
•	If not, prints error and does not multiply two matrices.
